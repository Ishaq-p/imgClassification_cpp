#### Basic Usage
To display CPU usage statistics:

```bash
mpstat
```

#### Per-Processor Statistics
To display statistics for each individual processor:

```bash
mpstat -P ALL
```

This command updates the statistics every 2 seconds.

To specify the number of updates, add the count as the second argument:

```bash
mpstat 2 5
```

This command updates the statistics every 2 seconds, for a total of 5 updates.

### Understanding the Output

The output of `mpstat` consists of several columns. Here's what each column represents:

#### CPU
- `CPU`: The processor number. `all` means the summary of all processors.

#### CPU Time Breakdown
- `%usr`: Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application).
- `%nice`: Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with nice priority.
- `%sys`: Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel).
- `%iowait`: Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.
- `%irq`: Percentage of time spent servicing hardware interrupts.
- `%soft`: Percentage of time spent servicing software interrupts.
- `%steal`: Percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.
- `%guest`: Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual processor.
- `%gnice`: Percentage of time spent by the CPU running a virtual processor with a nice priority.
- `%idle`: Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O request.

### Example Usage

#### Monitor System for a Specific Time Period

To monitor the system every second for 10 seconds and display per-processor statistics:

```bash
mpstat -P ALL 1 10
```


`mpstat` is a powerful tool for monitoring CPU usage and understanding the distribution of CPU time across various tasks and processors. By using `mpstat`, you can diagnose performance issues and gain insights into how your system's CPU resources are being utilized.
